    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose**:\n",
    "   - The heuristic function calculates the Manhattan distance between two points `a` and `b` on a grid.\n",
    "   - It is used to guide the A* algorithm by providing an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameters**:\n",
    "   - `a`: A tuple `(x1, y1)` representing the coordinates of the current node.\n",
    "   - `b`: A tuple `(x2, y2)` representing the coordinates of the goal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The Manhattan distance is calculated as:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     distance = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - This assumes movement is allowed only in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Value**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the computed Manhattan distance as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Manhattan Distance?\n",
    "- The Manhattan distance is suitable for grids where diagonal movement is not allowed.\n",
    "- It provides a simple and efficient way to estimate the distance between two points, ensuring the A* algorithm remains optimal and complete.\n"

    "\n",
    "3. **Logic**:\n",
    "   - The function iterates over four possible movements: **Up**, **Down**, **Left**, **Right**.\n",
    "   - For each direction, it calculates the potential new position `(nx, ny)`.\n",
    "   - It checks if the new position is within bounds and not blocked by a wall (`maze[nx][ny] != 1`).\n",
    "\n",
